Congratulations! 
I want to introduce you to the car rental service. 
The service allows you to view the cars offered and place an order by phone on a car rental company.

The application consists of 3 pages: 
1. A home page with a general description of the services provided by the company; 
2. A page containing cars catalog with configuration information that you can filter by brand, the hourly price of the lease and the number of kilometers that the car drove; 
3. Page with ads you choose as beloved.
